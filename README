FOOD ITEM DETECTION
(using openCV2--Python2)

This work is a part of a project used to identify the food items in a elementary school students' meal plate.

The algorithm is as follows:
1. Find the region of interest (for e.g. in this case it is sauce)
2. Input the test image where sauce is to be detected
3. Convert both the test image and the ROI image to HSV 
4. Calculate the corresponding histograms
5. Normalize the histogram and apply back projection
6. Then convolute with circular disc
7. Determine a feasible threshold and do a binary AND
8. Convert the resulatnt image to GRAYSCALE
9. Determine the contours in the image and select the largest one
10. Find the corresponding MAX and MIN points in the largest contour (this is done to find the starting point of the corresponding object to be detected and also the height and width of the bounding box)
11. From the returned contour values, find the contours which have lengths more than 1350 (this is basically done to neglect the false positive images)
12. Determine a stopping criteria to be used as an argument to MEAN SHIFT FILTER
13. Apply MEAN SHIFT FILTER and generate the corresponding result.
14. AN example of resultant figures is given.
